# project-yborger1
This is a final project for the class "Computational Images" taught by Professor Keith O'Hara at Swarthmore College. Some of the initial code (such as the initial hand tracking model) was provided by the professor, but the main project was solo work.
As I was writing the code alongside other finals, I came to the decision that a two-dimensional drawing (that I also did) would be the best option as I did not have the time to render the three-dimensional models as I would have liked to. 

Due to the unfortunate incident that is seeing a mouse in the computer labs, I did accidentally delete my original write-up (shut down my lab device without saving), and fully remade my write-up from scratch. Due to fear of the previous situation happening again, I uploaded it as a PDF instead.
The write-up that is in this repository covers the purpose of each function and additional class, as well as more expectations of the write-up. It is significantly more than the word count, and for that I apologize to Professor Keith O'Hara.
